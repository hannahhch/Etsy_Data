# Etsy Data

## Iron Yard Assignment

I wrote my JavaScript functions to the console, but had to change them to return statements in order to get the information on an HTML page.

## Extra

- I created an HTML page and styled in with CSS. I put all of my function data into a table.
- I put a home icon and linked it to Etsy
